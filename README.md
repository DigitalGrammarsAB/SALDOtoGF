# SALDO to GF

Script for importing SALDO as a GF grammar

- Based primarily on the work of Malin Ahlberg: <https://github.com/MalinAhlberg/SwedishProject/tree/master/saldo>
- Also see Krasimir's older import script: [make-saldo.hs](make-saldo.hs)

Currently being updated by John J. Camilleri to work with latest version/format of SALDO.
Much cleanup/work remains.
